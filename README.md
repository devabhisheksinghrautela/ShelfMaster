This repository consists of a Library Management System using C++ 

LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

Overview

The LibArray Management System is a library management tool developed in C++. It provides functionality to manage a collection of books, including adding, removing, searching, and displaying book details. This project is designed to demonstrate core C++ programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and data structures.

Features

Add Books: Add new books to the library's collection.

Remove Books: Remove books based on their unique identifier.

Search Books: Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.

Display Books: View all books in the library with their details.

Persistent Storage: Save and load library data using file handling for persistent storage.

Technologies Used:

C++: The core programming language for the application.

File Handling: To store and retrieve book data.

Standard Template Library (STL): For efficient data management.

Future Enhancements

1. Implementing user authentication for library administrators.

2. Adding a graphical user interface (GUI).

3. Supporting multi-user environments with concurrent access.

4. Exporting book lists to CSV or PDF formats.





Project Setup:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
